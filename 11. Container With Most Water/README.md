# 11. Container With Most Water
 ## Explination :
   Calculate the maxmum area for the container to carry water
 ## Algorithm :
   - Make two pointer one to point to the head and the second for tail
   - While the head pointer greater than the tail
     - Calculate the width of the container
     - Find the smallest height between the head and the tail in the array
     - Calculate the area and find the maxmum value of the area
   - Return the max value of the area
