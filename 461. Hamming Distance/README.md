 ## Explination:
  - Find the hamming distance of two variables 

 ## Algorithm:
  - If you have no idea about hamming distance check this link (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-hamming-distance)
  - First make XOR (^) for the two variables
  - Then check how many ones in the binary representation of the number 
  - Return the number
