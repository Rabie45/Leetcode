 - if the number Divisible by 5 write in the array "Buzz"
 - if the number Divisible by 5 and 3 write in the array "FizzBuzz"
 ## Algorithm:
 - Make a space in the memory to allocate the array
 - Create for loop to check every element 
 - if the number Divisible by 3 write in the array "Fizz"
 - if the number Divisible by 5 write in the array "Buzz"
 - if the number Divisible by 5 and 3 (or 15)write in the array "FizzBuzz"
 - so for every time make a space in the memory to save the the word 
 - At the end return the doublel array
